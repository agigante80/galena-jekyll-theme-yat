# Galena.es – AI-Driven Content Generation Blog

Welcome to the Galena.es repository! This site is a real-world production example designed for learning and experimentation with AI-powered content and image generation. Galena.es is a blog dedicated to the captivating universe of minerals, mining, and gemstones, featuring in-depth articles, guides, and news for geology enthusiasts, educators, and anyone curious about earth sciences.

This project demonstrates how modern AI technologies can be seamlessly integrated into a content workflow. All articles and images are generated automatically using [ContentGen-AI](https://github.com/agigante80/ContentGen-AI), a Python-based tool created by the site author to explore and learn about OpenAI API integration and prompt engineering.

## Overview

Galena.es is built with the Jekyll static site generator and styled with the 'YAT' (Yet Another Theme) for a clean, engaging user experience. The site is a showcase of how technology and creativity can combine to deliver high-quality, fully AI-generated content.

**Key Features:**
- **AI-Generated Content:** Every article is written by AI, leveraging the power of OpenAI's API via [ContentGen-AI](https://github.com/agigante80/ContentGen-AI).
- **AI-Generated Images:** Each post includes a unique, DALL-E-generated image, automatically created to match the article topic.
- **Production Example:** This is not just a demo—it's a live, production-grade site built for learning, experimentation, and real-world use.
- **Open Source:** All code and workflows are open for review, adaptation, and improvement.
