# Galena.es - AI-Driven Content Generation

Welcome to the repository for Galena.es, a demonstration website that showcases AI technologies in content and image creation. This initiative, managed by Andrea Gigante, fully embraces the potentials of AI through automatic content generated via OpenAI's API and visually complemented by images created using DALL-E.

## Overview

Galena.es uses the Jekyll static site generator with the 'YAT' (Yet Another Theme) theme to present a rich, engaging user experience that creatively incorporates AI-generated content. This project serves as a testament to the innovative intersection of technology and creativity in the IT field.

## Technology Stack

- **Jekyll**: A simple, yet powerful static site generator designed for personal, project, or organizational websites. [Learn more about Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
- **Theme**: Jekyll's YAT (Yet Another Theme) from [jeffreytse/jekyll-theme-yat](https://github.com/jeffreytse/jekyll-theme-yat).
- **AI Content Generation**: Content is dynamically generated using OpenAI's API.
- **Image Generation**: Each content piece is paired with a related image generated by DALL-E.
- **Hosting**: Hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Workflow

1. **Topic Management**:
   - Primary topics are extracted from `AI_content/list_of_NEW_topics.csv`.
   - Absence of available topics triggers the script to autonomously generate 10 new subjects.

2. **Content and Image Generation**:
   - Each topic initiates the OpenAI API to generate corresponding content, while DALL-E crafts an apt image.

3. **Composition of Pages**:
   - The pages are periodically assembled, incorporating both the textual and visual content, followed by an update to the website.
