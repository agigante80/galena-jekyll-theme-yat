# Unearthing Minerals in Everyday Household Items

## Introduction

Minerals, the building blocks of rocks, are not just confined to the crust of the Earth. They are omnipresent, even in the most mundane objects that populate our homes. This article aims to illuminate the unexpected places where minerals hide in our daily lives.

## Minerals in Our Homes

### Kitchen Essentials

Salt, the white granules that add flavor to our food, is a mineral known as halite. It is composed of two elements, sodium and chloride, which are necessary for our bodies to function correctly.

Baking soda, another kitchen staple, contains the mineral nahcolite. The 'na' stands for sodium, 'hco' for bicarbonate, and the 'lite' is a suffix used in mineralogy.

### Technological Devices

Our beloved smartphones are a treasure trove of minerals. From the gorilla glass screen made of silica to the lithium-ion battery, our tech gadgets are a testament to the variety and utility of minerals.

### Cosmetics

Even your makeup bag is a mineral mine! Talc, mica, and kaolinite are just a few of the minerals that give cosmetics their smooth texture and vibrant colors.
