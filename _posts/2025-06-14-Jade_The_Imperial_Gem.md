## Introduction

Jade, a gemstone of unique symbolic energy, and unique in the myths that surround it. With its beauty and wide-ranging expressiveness, jade has held a special attraction for mankind for thousands of years.

## The Historical Significance of Jade

Jade has been known in China as the 'royal gem' since the Neolithic period, dating back to 3000 B.C. The earliest Chinese character for jade, 'Yu', is found in inscriptions on bronzes and oracle bones dating from around 1200 B.C. The character incorporates the symbols for 'king' and 'gem', signifying the royal status of jade.

The Chinese have always valued jade more highly than gold. Yu is a term that refers to a fine, beautiful stone with a warm color and rich luster, considered to be a symbol of the good, the beautiful and the precious.

## The Cultural Significance of Jade

In Chinese culture, jade symbolizes nobility, perfection, constancy, and immortality. For millennia, jade has been an intimate part of the lives of Chinese of all ages and classes. It is also considered to protect the bearer from evil.
