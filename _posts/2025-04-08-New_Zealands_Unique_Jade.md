# Introduction

Rare and precious, the jade of New Zealand, also known as pounamu, has held a place of reverence in Maori culture and shaped the economic landscape of the island nation. As we delve into the heart of this green gemstone, we will uncover the layers of history, mythology, and significance it holds, from its geological formation to its influence in the modern gemstone market.

# The Origins and Formation of Jade

New Zealand's jade is a nephrite jade, one of the two types of pure jade, featuring intricate patterns and varying hues from translucent green to opaque dark green. The formation process of these gemstones began millions of years ago, deep within the Earth's crust, under the influence of immense pressure and heat. 

| Jade Type | Color | Translucency | Hardness |
|---|---|---|---|
| Nephrite | Varying green hues | From translucent to opaque | 6-6.5 on Mohs scale |
| Jadeite | Green, lavender, yellow, white, black | From translucent to opaque | 6.5-7 on Mohs scale |

# The Cultural Significance of Jade in Maori Tradition

In Maori culture, pounamu holds a special place, with its value extending beyond the physical and into the spiritual realm. Traditionally, it has been used in weaponry, ornamentation, and ritualistic ceremonies, with its strength and durability symbolizing power, authority, and status.

> "_In the mythology of Maori, pounamu is considered the embodiment of ancestors, a spiritual link connecting the living with the divine._"

# Jade Mining and its Economic Impact

The jade mining industry in New Zealand has evolved considerably over the centuries, from small-scale hand mining by the Maori to the use of modern machinery and techniques. The gemstone's popularity in the international market, particularly in Asia, has turned it into a significant contributor to New Zealand's economy.

# Sustainability and the Future of Jade Mining

With the increasing global focus on sustainable practices, New Zealand's jade mining industry is undergoing a transformation. The government has implemented strict regulations to ensure the preservation of the environment and the cultural values associated with pounamu.
