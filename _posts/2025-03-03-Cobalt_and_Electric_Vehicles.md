# Introduction

As we step into the era of electric vehicles (EVs) and renewable energy, one mineral silently plays a pivotal role: Cobalt. Despite its relative obscurity, this bluish-gray, hard, and magnetic metal is the backbone of every lithium-ion battery powering our modern-day EVs.

# The Importance of Cobalt in EVs

Cobalt serves as a critical component in the cathodes of lithium-ion batteries, the power source for most EVs. This metal allows these batteries to have high energy density, meaning they can store and deliver a significant amount of energy. Such a feature is vital for EVs, which require extensive energy storage to drive long distances.

Cobalt also provides stability to the battery structure, preventing overheating and maintaining safety. The characteristic is crucial for EVs, considering the potential risks associated with battery overheating or failure.

# Cobalt Mining

Cobalt primarily comes from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), accounting for over 60% of the global cobalt supply. However, cobalt mining in the DRC has faced criticism due to poor working conditions and the use of child labor. 

As a result, many companies are exploring the potential for 'ethical' cobalt sources. Still, the demand for cobalt continues to rise with the increasing production of EVs. 

# Cobalt Demand and Supply

| Year | Cobalt Demand (tons) | Cobalt Supply (tons) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2016 | 100,000 | 123,000 |
| 2020 | 120,000 | 140,000 |
| 2025 (Projected) | 240,000 | 260,000 |

The table above shows the rising demand and supply of cobalt over the past few years. The gap between demand and supply is narrowing, indicating potential future shortages.

> "Cobalt is the least abundant and most expensive component in battery chemistry. As the demand for electric vehicles increases, so does the demand for cobalt." - Dr. Andrew Miller, Product Director at Benchmark Mineral Intelligence.

# The Future of Cobalt and EVs

As the EV market continues to expand, so does the demand for cobalt. Despite the challenges associated with its mining, cobalt remains an indispensable part of EVs. 

Research is underway for alternative battery technologies that could reduce the dependence on cobalt. However, until a viable alternative emerges, cobalt will continue to be the 'unsung hero' of the EV revolution.

# Conclusion

The world of electric vehicles is inextricably linked with cobalt, a mineral often overlooked in discussions about renewable energy. As we appreciate the leaps we've made in sustainable transportation, let's also acknowledge the vital role of cobalt, making these advancements possible. The future of EVs and renewable energy hinges on how we manage our cobalt resources and navigate the challenges associated with them.
