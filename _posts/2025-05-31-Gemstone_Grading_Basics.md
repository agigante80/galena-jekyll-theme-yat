# Introduction
Gemstones have fascinated humans for thousands of years. Their scarcity, beauty, and unique characteristics make them precious and desirable. But what makes a gemstone high quality? This article delves into the basics of gemstone grading, a critical aspect that determines a gemstone's value and appeal.

# The Four Cs of Gemstone Grading
The quality and value of a gemstone are determined by four key factors, collectively known as the Four Cs: Color, Clarity, Cut, and Carat weight.

## Color
Color is the most significant factor in determining a gemstone's value. It's assessed based on three attributes: hue, tone, and saturation. 

- Hue refers to the actual color of the stone, such as blue, red, or green.
- Tone refers to the darkness or lightness of the color.
- Saturation refers to the intensity of a gem's color.

The ideal gemstone has a pure hue, medium to dark tone, and strong to vivid color saturation.

## Clarity
Clarity refers to the presence of internal or external flaws, known as inclusions and blemishes, respectively. Gemstones with fewer flaws have higher clarity, making them more valuable. Clarity grades range from Flawless (no inclusions or blemishes visible under 10x magnification) to Included (inclusions and/or blemishes visible to the naked eye).

## Cut
The cut of a gemstone doesn't refer to its shape, but rather how well it has been cut from its raw form. Factors such as symmetry, proportions, and polish are considered. A well-cut gemstone reflects light beautifully, enhancing its innate color and minimizing visible inclusions.

## Carat Weight
Carat weight is the physical weight of the gemstone. One carat equals 200 milligrams. Larger stones are rarer and therefore more valuable, all other factors being equal.

## Gemstone Grading Table

| Gemstone | Ideal Color | Clarity Grade | Ideal Cut | Average Carat Weight |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------- | --------- | -------------------- |
| Diamond  | Colorless   | Flawless      | Excellent | 1.00                |
| Ruby     | Vivid Red   | Slightly Included | Excellent | 1.00                |
| Sapphire | Vivid Blue  | Slightly Included | Excellent | 1.00                |
| Emerald  | Vivid Green | Included     | Good      | 1.00                |
