This article delves into some of the most notorious gem heists in history, unraveling the thrilling tales of these daring escapades.

## The Antwerp Diamond Heist
Labelled as the "heist of the century", the Antwerp Diamond Heist in 2003 saw the theft of diamonds, gold, and other gems from the Antwerp World Diamond Centre, worth over $100 million. The mastermind, Leonardo Notarbartolo, was caught but the loot was never recovered.

## The Theft of the Irish Crown Jewels
