# Introduction

The world of geology is vast and intriguing, providing us with precious resources that drive our modern lives. Among these resources, rare earth elements (REEs) hold a significant place due to their application in various high-tech industries. This article explores the pivotal role of Singapore, a small yet potent country, in the global rare earth processing industry.

# Singapore's Unique Position in the Rare Earth Industry

Singapore's journey into the rare earth industry is a remarkable story. Despite not having any natural mining resources, it has carved a unique niche in the global rare earth industry through its strategic location, robust infrastructure, and efficient trade policies. Today, it is one of the world's leading hubs for refining and distributing rare earth elements.

# The Rare Earth Refining Process

Rare earth refining is a complex process. It involves a series of steps from mining, extraction, separation, refining, to alloying. Singapore excels in the final stages of this process - refining and alloying. The country houses state-of-the-art facilities that employ advanced technologies for refining rare earth ores into usable products.

# Singapore's Rare Earth Trade

Singapore is also a crucial player in the global trade of rare earths. Its strategic location at the heart of Southeast Asia, coupled with its status as a global shipping hub, allows it to facilitate the seamless transport of rare earths across the globe.

| Country | 2019 Rare Earth Exports (Tonnes) | % of World Exports |
|---------|-------------------------|-------------------|
| China   | 21,000                  | 67.7%             |
| USA     | 26,000                  | 16.5%             |
| Australia| 3,300                  | 10.6%             |
| Myanmar | 1,100                  | 3.5%              |
| Others  | 770                     | 1.7%              |
