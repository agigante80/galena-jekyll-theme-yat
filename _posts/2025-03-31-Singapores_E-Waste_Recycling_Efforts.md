## Introduction

In the age of rapid technological advancement, electronic waste, or e-waste, has become a global concern. But amongst the countries grappling with the proper disposal of e-waste, Singapore shines as a beacon of innovation and success. This article delves into Singapore's dedicated efforts in e-waste recycling and the recovery of valuable minerals from discarded electronics.

## The E-Waste Challenge

Globally, around 53.6 million metric tons of e-waste was generated in 2019, a number expected to surge by 21% till 2030. Comprising discarded electronic devices and components, e-waste holds a wealth of recoverable materials like gold, silver, copper, and palladium.

## Singapore's E-Waste Recycling Strategy

In Singapore, approximately 60,000 tons of e-waste is generated every year. To manage this, the country has adopted a multi-pronged recycling strategy.

### Regulatory Framework

The Resource Sustainability Act implemented in 2021 mandates producers of electronic products to ensure their products are properly recycled when discarded. This legislation has significantly boosted Singapore's e-waste recycling rates.

### Advanced Recycling Facilities

Singapore houses advanced recycling facilities that safely extract valuable metals from e-waste. These facilities use hydrometallurgical methods, a process that involves the use of aqueous chemistry to recover metals.

### Public Awareness

Singapore has also undertaken extensive public awareness campaigns to educate citizens about responsible e-waste disposal and the importance of recycling.

| Year | E-Waste Generated (Tons) | E-Waste Recycled (Tons) |
| ---- | ------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| 2015 | 50,000                   | 10,000                  |
| 2016 | 52,000                   | 15,000                  |
| 2017 | 55,000                   | 20,000                  |
| 2018 | 58,000                   | 25,000                  |
| 2019 | 60,000                   | 30,000                  |
| 2020 | 63,000                   | 35,000                  |

The table above provides a snapshot of Singapore's progress in e-waste recycling over the years.

## Conclusion

Singapore's efforts in e-waste recycling are a testament to its commitment towards environmental sustainability. By creating a robust regulatory framework, investing in advanced recycling technologies, and promoting public awareness, the island nation is paving the way for a sustainable future. It serves as an inspiration to other nations and proves that with concerted efforts, it is possible to turn 'waste' into 'wealth'.
