## Introduction

The earth beneath us is a treasure trove of minerals and gemstones, each one uniquely formed under varying geological conditions. More than just their scientific properties, these crystals and gemstones have long been revered for their purported metaphysical properties. This article delves into the world of crystal healing, exploring the beliefs and lore surrounding the metaphysical properties of these beautiful gifts from the earth.

## The Metaphysical World of Crystals and Gemstones

From ancient times, civilizations across the world have attributed spiritual significance to crystals and gemstones. They've been used in spiritual practices, to promote healing and wellbeing, and even to enhance psychic abilities.

### Understanding Metaphysical Properties

The metaphysical properties of crystals and gemstones are believed to emanate from the vibrations or energy they hold, due to their atomic composition. This energy is thought to resonate with the human energy field, helping to restore balance and promote positive energy.

_"Crystals are living beings at the beginning of creation. All things have a frequency and a vibration."_ - Nikola Tesla

## The Science Behind the Metaphysical Properties

While the metaphysical properties of crystals aren't supported by mainstream science, the placebo effect might play a role. The belief in the power of these crystals can promote a sense of wellbeing and positivity.

[Recent research](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08927936.2019.1658258) suggests that the color of the crystals can influence the perceived healing properties. This aligns with color therapy principles, where different colors are believed to influence different aspects of physical and emotional health.

While science may not fully support the healing properties of crystals, their beauty and the sense of peace they bring can't be denied.
