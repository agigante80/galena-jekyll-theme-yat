# Introduction

Tugtupite, a captivating gemstone that originates from Greenland, is fast becoming a favorite among jewelers and gem enthusiasts worldwide. This gemstone, with its unusual fluorescence and intense color that ranges from white to deep red, is gaining popularity for its unique features and the innovative uses in jewelry design.

# Tugtupite and Its Characteristics

Tugtupite, first discovered in 1962 in the Tugtup AgtakÃ´rfia area in Greenland, is a member of the sodalite group of minerals. It's known for its tenebrescence, a rare optical phenomenon that changes the color of the mineral when exposed to sunlight. This gemstone can exhibit a range of colors, from white or pale pink in its natural state to a deep crimson when exposed to sunlight or heat.

Its Mohs hardness is 4, making it a relatively soft stone, hence it requires careful handling. Despite this, the unique characteristics of Tugtupite make it a coveted mineral for jewelry design.
