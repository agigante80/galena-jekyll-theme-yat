# Introduction

Poudretteite, a mineral gemstone as precious as its name is unique, is a prized possession for collectors worldwide. Pegged as one of the rarest gemstones on Earth, its charm lies not just in its captivating pink hue, but also in its scarcity.

# The Allure of Poudretteite

Poudretteite (pronounced as pow-dret-tite), was first discovered in Mont Saint-Hilaire, Quebec, Canada, in the 1960s. Named after the Poudrette family who operated the quarry where it was found, this gem has since held a special place in the hearts of collectors and geology enthusiasts.

Its rarity is due to its specific formation conditions. It is formed in pegmatites, igneous rocks formed from lava or magma that are rich in water at the time of their formation. These conditions are not common, making the occurrence of Poudretteite quite rare.
