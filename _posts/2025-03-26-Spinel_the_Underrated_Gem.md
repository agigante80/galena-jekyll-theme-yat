# Spinel - The Underrated Gem in the Jewellery World

In the world of gemstones, there are a few names that immediately spring to mind; diamonds, rubies, sapphires. But there is one stone that, despite its beauty and versatility, often goes unnoticed: spinel. This gem, with its striking brilliance and extensive color range, deserves a second look.

## Exploring the Origins of Spinel

Spinel originates from the Latin word 'spina', which translates to 'thorn'. This is a nod to the sharp, pointed crystals of the gemstone. Spinel is formed from a mineral called corundum, the same mineral responsible for rubies and sapphires. The stones are often found together in the same mining regions, leading to their frequent misidentification. 

The history of spinel is rich with tales of mistaken identity. Perhaps the most famous case is the 'Black Princeâ€™s Ruby' - a large, red gem set in the Imperial State Crown of England. Despite its name, it's actually a spinel!

## Unveiling the Colors of Spinel

One of the most appealing characteristics of spinel is its wide array of colors. Ranging from vibrant pinks and purples to deep blues and even black, there is a spinel to suit any taste.
