# Introduction

Luxembourg, though small in size, is a country with a grand legacy that resonates through the annals of its industrial history. An often overlooked protagonist in this narrative is iron ore, the unassuming mineral that shaped Luxembourg's economic and social fabric. This article will transport you back in time, tracing the iron ore mining legacy of Luxembourg and its profound economic impact.

# The Dawn of Iron Ore Mining in Luxembourg

The tale of iron ore mining in Luxembourg commenced in the pre-Roman era, but it gained prominence in the 19th century during the Industrial Revolution. The southern region of Luxembourg, known as 'Minett,' is rich in high-quality iron ore deposits. The advent of the blast furnace technology revolutionized the mining industry, propelling Luxembourg to become one of Europe's leading iron and steel producers.

# The Golden Age of Luxembourg's Iron Ore Mining

During the early 20th century, Luxembourg's iron ore mines were bustling with activity. The industry saw a significant boom, especially during the two World Wars, providing the much-needed impetus to Luxembourg's economy. 

However, the post-war period was not as kind to the iron ore industry. With the exhaustion of high-grade ores and stiff competition from foreign markets, the mining industry saw a gradual decline.

# Economic Impact of Iron Ore Mining

Iron ore mining played a pivotal role in shaping Luxembourg's economy. At its peak, the industry employed over 20,000 people and accounted for nearly 80% of the country's total industrial production.

| Year | Iron Ore Production (in tons) | Percentage of Total Industrial Production |
|------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| 1913 | 5,867,000                     | 72%                                    |
| 1937 | 3,477,000                     | 78%                                    |
| 1960 | 1,878,000                     | 50%                                    |
