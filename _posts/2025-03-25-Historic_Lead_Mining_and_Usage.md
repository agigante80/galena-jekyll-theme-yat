# Introduction
From the annals of antiquity to the industrial revolution, lead has been an integral part of human civilization. This dense, malleable, and corrosion-resistant metal has been extracted and utilized for more than 8,000 years, making it one of the first metals to be smelted by humans. This article delves into the fascinating history and development of lead mining and usage.

# Mining through the Ages
## Ancient Times
Lead mining is as old as civilization itself. The earliest evidence of lead mining dates back to approximately 6500 BCE in modern-day Turkey. The Romans were known for their intricate lead pipe systems and also used lead in cosmetics, paints, and even as a sweetening agent in food and wine.

## Middle Ages
During the Middle Ages, lead was widely used in building construction, particularly for roofing and plumbing. The mining of lead became more advanced, with the introduction of techniques like fire-setting.

## Industrial Revolution
The Industrial Revolution saw a surge in lead mining and production, with the advent of steam-powered machinery and efficient smelting techniques. Lead found usage in a multitude of applications, ranging from paint to petrol additives.

## Modern Times
In the 20th century, the hazards associated with lead became more recognized, leading to a decline in its use. However, lead continues to be mined and used in batteries, ammunition, and radiation shielding.
