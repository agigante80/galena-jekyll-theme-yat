# Introduction
Xenon, a noble gas, known for its reluctance to partake in chemical reactions, presents an intriguing exception in the form of xenon oxides. These unusual compounds challenge the traditional understanding of xenon's inert nature and present a fascinating area of exploration in the world of minerals and gemstones. This article delves into the intriguing world of xenon oxides, examining their unique stability conditions.

# The Anomaly of Xenon Oxides
Xenon oxides are a rarity in the realm of geochemistry. As members of the noble gas family, xenon atoms are typically chemically inert due to their complete electron shells. However, under certain conditions, xenon can form stable compounds with other elements, most notably oxygen, resulting in xenon oxides.

The most common forms of xenon oxides are Xenon hexafluoride (XeO3) and Xenon tetroxide (XeO4). These compounds exhibit unique properties and behaviors, challenging conventional wisdom about the chemical reactivity of noble gases.

# Stability Conditions of Xenon Oxides
The stability of xenon oxides is highly dependent on their surrounding conditions. Key factors include temperature, pressure, and the presence of other substances. 

| Xenon Oxide | Stability Condition |
| ----------- | ------------------- |
| XeO3        | Stable at room temperature and explodes above 0℃ |
| XeO4        | Stable below -36.0℃ and explodes above that |

It's fascinating to note that while XeO3 is stable at room temperature, it becomes explosive when heated. On the other hand, XeO4 is stable at temperatures below -36.0℃; however, it becomes explosive when exposed to higher temperatures.

# The Quote
