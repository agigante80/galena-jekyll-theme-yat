# Introduction

From the depths of the earth to the forefront of medical science, platinum, a precious metal, has found a pivotal role in cancer treatment. This article delves into the fascinating journey of platinum from its mineral form to its application in oncology.

# Platinum Compounds in Cancer Treatment

Platinum is not only a symbol of wealth and prestige but also a lifesaver in the fight against cancer. Platinum-based chemotherapy drugs, such as cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin, have been instrumental in treating various types of cancer, including testicular, ovarian, lung, bladder, and head and neck cancers.

## The Mechanism of Action

Platinum compounds work by causing DNA damage in cancer cells. The platinum atom binds to the DNA, distorting its structure and preventing the cancer cell from replicating. This disruption eventually leads to cell death, reducing the size and spread of the cancerous mass.

## Evolution of Platinum Drugs

First synthesized in the 1960s, cisplatin was a groundbreaking discovery in cancer treatment. However, its severe side effects led to the development of less toxic alternatives like carboplatin and oxaliplatin. These drugs are now a cornerstone of cancer treatment, offering hope to millions around the world.
