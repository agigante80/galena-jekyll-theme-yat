# Introduction

Jagoite is a rare and captivating mineral that has intrigued geologists and gem enthusiasts alike for decades. It's a lead arsenate hydroxide mineral with an unusual crystal structure and a vibrant range of colors. This mineral's rarity and unique properties make it a specimen of great interest in geological studies.

# Chemical Composition

Jagoite is a lead arsenate mineral with the chemical formula Pb3Cu3(AsO4)(AsO3OH)(OH)6. This formula indicates that Jagoite is composed of three lead atoms, three copper atoms, four arsenate atoms, one arsenite atom, and six hydroxide atoms. This chemical makeup gives Jagoite its unique properties and makes it so intriguing to scientists and researchers.


| Element | Symbol | Quantity |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Lead    | Pb     | 3        |
| Copper  | Cu     | 3        |
| Arsenate| AsO4   | 4        |
| Arsenite| AsO3OH | 1        |
| Hydroxide| OH    | 6        |


# Physical Properties

The physical properties of Jagoite make it easily recognizable and distinguishable from other minerals. It typically crystallizes in a hexagonal crystal system, forming short prismatic or tabular crystals. The mineral exhibits a brilliant blue to green color, which can vary depending on the specific environment of formation. 

Jagoite has a vitreous to pearly luster and a hardness of 4.5 on the Mohs scale, making it relatively soft compared to other minerals. It is also known to be brittle with an uneven fracture, and it exhibits perfect cleavage, which is a characteristic property of this mineral.

# Notable Occurrences

Jagoite was first discovered in 1966 in the Tintic District of Utah, USA. Since then, it's been found in other locations worldwide, including Mexico and Namibia. However, it remains a rare mineral, with limited occurrences, adding to its allure and intrigue.
