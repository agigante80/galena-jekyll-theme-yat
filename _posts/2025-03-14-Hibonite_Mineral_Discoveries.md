# Introduction

Welcome to a journey into the world of Hibonite, a rare and remarkable mineral. Named after Paul Hibon, a French prospector who discovered it in Madagascar in 1956, Hibonite has since fascinated geologists and gem enthusiasts alike due to its unique properties and rarity.

# Discovering Hibonite

Hibonite is primarily found in meteorites and is believed to be one of the first minerals to have formed in our solar system. The mineral's presence in meteorites is a testimony to its extraterrestrial origin and the extreme conditions it endured, making it a subject of great interest among scientists.

## Hibonite in Madagascar

Paul Hibon’s discovery of Hibonite in Madagascar unveiled a mineral that had, until then, been unknown. He found Hibonite in alluvial deposits – a geological term for material deposited by rivers. Madagascar's unique geology, which includes a rich array of gemstones and minerals, proved to be the perfect setting for Hibonite’s discovery.

## Hibonite Around the World

While the earliest discovery of Hibonite was in Madagascar, it has since been found in other parts of the world. Notably, it has been discovered in Myanmar, Sri Lanka, and Tanzania. These discoveries have expanded our understanding of Hibonite and its formation under varied geological conditions.

# Mining Hibonite

Mining Hibonite is a complex and labor-intensive process due to its rarity and the difficulty in distinguishing it from other minerals. Moreover, the sites where Hibonite is found are often remote and challenging to access.

# Hibonite’s Unique Properties

Hibonite is renowned for its hardness, ranking 7.5-8 on the Mohs hardness scale. Its color ranges from brownish-black to greenish-black, and it exhibits a submetallic luster. These characteristics make Hibonite an attractive mineral for collectors and researchers alike.
