# Unearthing the Tale of Zektzerite Discovery

## Introduction

Our planet's crust is a treasure trove, concealing countless minerals each with their unique properties and stories. Among these, Zektzerite stands out as a truly intriguing mineral. This article will guide you through the captivating tale of its discovery and shed light on its unique properties.

## The Discovery of Zektzerite

Zektzerite was discovered in 1966 in the Washington state's North Cascades. The mineral was named after the American mineralogist Richard (Dick) Zektzer, who first found it. Born from the fiery belly of our planet, Zektzerite has graced the earth with its presence for millions of years, waiting patiently to be discovered.

## The Unique Properties of Zektzerite

Zektzerite, a lithium, zirconium silicate mineral, is known for its beautiful pink to colourless appearance. It is a rare gemstone, and its crystals are usually found as small, flat, and rectangular prisms. 

The following table lays out the key properties of Zektzerite:

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Color** | Pink to colorless |
| **Crystal System** | Orthorhombic |
| **Cleavage** | None |
| **Luster** | Vitreous |
| **Hardness** | 6.5 - 7 on the Mohs scale |
| **Density** | 2.98 g/cmÂ³ |

Despite its beauty, Zektzerite is not commonly used in jewelry due to its rarity and relatively low hardness, which makes it prone to scratching.
